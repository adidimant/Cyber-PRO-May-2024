1) Look at the forEach example from the class (!arrays.js file).
Using map & join - create an html string for the html body - without using forEach.
You should get the same results.

2) write a function that gets an array of string numbers, and returns an array of this numbers as numbers (using map)

3) write a function that gets an array of boolean values, and returns an array of 1/0. if the item in the original array was true - then the same place in the result array should be 1, otherwise - 0.

4) write a function that gets a string, and for every character in the string - console.log it.
you should do it with arr.forEach function (on array!)

5) write a function that gets an array of passwords, and returns an object which every key is the index, and every value is the password. you should use forEach function.

6) given an array of names (strings), filter all the short names (short names have maximum 5 letters)

7) given an array of anything - filter only the numbers

8) given an array of numbers - filter only the even numbers (even number divide by two)
