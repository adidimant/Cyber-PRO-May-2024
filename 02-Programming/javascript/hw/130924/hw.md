Write all the following functions (in a separate .js file and not .html file):
1) this is your object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

create a copy for person to a new variable

play with the object, add at least 3 properties (keys), and edit at least 2 properties

console.log() both object in the browser console - see the difference between the objects

2) create a `utils` object, the object keys will be the name of the functions from last hw
the value of these keys will be the actual functions.
then use this utils object in order to use the functions

include in the object the function that converts celsius to farenigeht temprature and other function that does the opposite

3) create a function that gets a url as a parameter
checks if the hostname of the url in the website you stay now is the same hostname of the url
if yes - does nothing
if not - redirect to the new url

4) create function that gets two parameters:
 - object with any keys you would like (lets say at least 4 keys)
 - array of strings, that represents the required keys to be in the object
 the function should check if the object contains all the keys in the array
 the function return true/false

 two levels of hardndess:
 1) solve the question with: the array has maximum of 4 items
 2) solve the question with: the array has unknown number of items
