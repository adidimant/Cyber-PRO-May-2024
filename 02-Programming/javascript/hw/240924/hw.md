1) Write your own implementation for padStart function on arrays - the function should get: 1) an array, 2) what's the maximum size of the array should be, 3) which value to pad - the function returns the array with a padding at the beginning of what you wrote.

2) write a function that finds the second largest element in the array.
hint: use the sort() function

3) write a function that gets one array and splits it to a half, the function should return a new array that the first item is halfarray, the second item is the another half array. example: splitHalf([1,2,3,4]) => [[1,2],[3,4]]

4) write a function that gets two number arrays and check if the arrays are equal.
hint: you can use JSON.stringify()

5) write a function that gets an array of numbers and check if all the items are unique (no duplicates in the arrays) - the function should return a boolean value - true/false

6) write a function called "removeAt" - that gets an array, gets an index to remove - and returned a new array - but without the item that needed to remove. NOTE - you should not change the original array! using just splice on the original array will change it!

7) Write a function that accepts two arrays of numbers, the arrays has both the length 5, the function should return an array that is the sum of the two arrays
