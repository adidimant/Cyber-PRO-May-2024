1) Choose 4 questions from previous HW (for loops) - and implement their solution using a while loop.

2) Math.random(); // creates a random string in the range of 0 to 1
Create a function that return a number in the range of 0 to 100

3) Math.random(); // creates a random string in the range of 0 to 1
Create a lottery function, that returns a number in the range of 0 to 6000000

4) Write a function that accepts a number n, randomize number between 0 to 100, and return how much you can divide the random number with n.
note - please use what you created in question #2 as well
the function also should console.log the random number that was chosen
