1) Create a new website with your own form
the form should be of another concept (not a user registration form like in the first js/html homework)

Activate on your website (only using javascript!) at least 6 different event listeners on at least 6 different elements
every event listener should be with different implementation as well - some basic examples:
1) changing something in the style
2) changing texts
3) add/remove elements from the DOM

2) on the same website, use the global: `document.addEventListener('some-event', someFunction)`
