Question 1: Create a class called Animal, and receive all the relevant fields for a creation of an animal
mandatory fields: animal_type, name, age, legs_count, is_predator (boolean)
write functions that gets/sets the values of these fields for the instance of the class
for example - i want to be able to use:

animal1.set_is_predator(True)
then:
print(animal1.get_is_predator())
will print True

Question 2: Create a class called User, and receive all the relevant parameters for a creation of an user in your system
mandatory fields: register_date, first_name, last_name, birthdate, last_login, user_id, password
the User class should extend the class Person - extend a class means it gets all the functionality from the parent class
(if i'm telling that class User extends Person - it means that User is also a Person)
write at least 4 different functions regarding the user fields (be creative, for example - a function that calculates how many time the user is registered in the system)

Question 3 - Write a function is_palindrome(s) that checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). the function should return True/False
examples:
abba is a palindrome
aba is a palindrome
a is a palindrome
ab is not a palindrome
abc is not a palindrome
'' is a palindrome
bba is not a palindrome

Question 4 - write a function that recieves a body of http request (as a string), and checks how many new lines there are in the body. the function should return the counter
